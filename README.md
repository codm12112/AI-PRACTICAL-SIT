# 🚀 AI Practicals

## 🧑‍🎓 Student Details:
- **Name:** PREET PATEL
- **Semester:** VI  
- **Section:** C  
- **PRN:** 22070521088 

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of various AI practicals completed as part of the Semester VI curriculum. The practicals cover fundamental AI concepts, including search algorithms, constraint satisfaction problems, and NLP techniques.In addition to it I have made a project on IMDb sentiment analysis,ppt,dataset.
I hope you like my repository enjoy!!!.

## 🔥 Practicals Implemented:

### 1️⃣ Breadth-First Search (BFS) Implementation 
- Implemented BFS on a given dataset.
- Explores nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

### 2️⃣ Depth-First Search (DFS) Implementation 
- Implemented DFS on a given dataset.
- Explores as deep as possible before backtracking, useful for pathfinding and solving puzzles.

### 3️⃣ 8-Queens Problem ♟️
- Implemented a solution for the 8-Queens problem using backtracking.
- Ensures that no two queens attack each other on the chessboard.

### 4️⃣ Introduction to Open Source NLP Tools 
- Explored NLP libraries such as **NLTK** for text analysis and processing.
- Gained insights into tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and feature extraction.

### 5️⃣ Text Preprocessing with NLTK 📝
- Implemented tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming for a case study application.
- Used **NLTK** to preprocess text data for further analysis.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Programs
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-practicals.git
   cd ai-practicals
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```
3. Run individual scripts using C and Python:
   ```bash
   BFS.c
   DFS.c
   python 8queens.py
   python text_preprocessing.py
   ```

## 🎯 Conclusion
These AI practicals provide hands-on experience with fundamental concepts in artificial intelligence, including search algorithms, constraint satisfaction problems, and natural language processing. The implementations serve as a foundational step in understanding AI problem-solving techniques.
